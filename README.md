## 🔬 Experiments Conducted

1. **Motion Analysis of Human Finger**  
   Analyzed the kinematics of human finger motion using motion tracking software to study the effects of mass distribution on movement characteristics.

2. **Static Analysis of a Human Wrist**  
   Performed static analysis of the human wrist to evaluate joint stability and muscle response under varying load conditions using motion tracking and simulation.    

3. **Robotic Gripper Analysis**  
   Analyzed the force exerted by a robotic gripper across varying apertures to evaluate its performance and optimize grip design under different conditions.

4. **Forward Kinematics of a Manipulator (MATLAB)**  
   Developed and validated a forward kinematics model of a serial manipulator using MATLAB and Denavit-Hartenberg parameters.  

5. **Robot Manipulability Measurement**  
   Measured a robot's manipulability using MATLAB by analyzing how different configurations affect the Jacobian, force ellipsoid, and velocity ellipsoid.

6. **Friction Coefficient and Power Estimation**  
   Investigated the linear equivalent friction coefficient and maximum power required for robot movement under different load conditions to enhance energy efficiency and performance.

7. **Gear Ratio Analysis of a Mobile Robot**  
   Analyzed how different gear ratios affect motor current, efficiency, and overall system performance to determine the optimal gear ratio for mobile robot operation.

8. **Friction Measurement in a Linear System**  
    Measured friction in a linear system by analyzing motion parameters to calculate static and kinetic friction coefficients, providing insights into system efficiency and performance.
